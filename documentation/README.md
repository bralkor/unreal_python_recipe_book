<h2 align="center">Documentation</h2>

<p align="center">
This documentation will cover how Unreal's systems work in Python<br>
and help to expose what's possible with it
</p>

<br>

This Python documentation covers many aspects of Unreal and is meant for users who are familiar with both
Python and Unreal Engine. It will provide links to official documentation when possible, but the primary
focus is on building working examples rather than explaining Unreal's toolsets or concepts. The primary goal of
this project is to show how the pieces go together in Python.

Any code shown should be present in the provided Unreal plugin's Python modules but there may be some differences
to help with clutter and formatting. Some code snippets may reference modules such as `unreal_systems` or `metadata` from the plugin's
Python modules, if it doesn't start with `unreal` and hasn't been explained it's probably from another module within this project.
